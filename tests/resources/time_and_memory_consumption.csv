4.3. Sample design - full information,"The sample was drawn directly from the electoral roll, though only individuals who actually voted were considered.","A stratified sample of 7,499 foreign citizens with voting rights was pulled. The size of the strata was adjusted to minimize differences in actual size differences and response rates, so that small groups or groups with assumed low response rates could be included.","A sample of 1,307 people with foreign citizenship was pulled, and a sample of 1,842 people with Norwegian citizenship was pulled. The sample was then divided into more strata based on different regions (Asia, Africa, Latin America or East Europe).","Two strata (Norwegians, foreign citizens) was first identified. Different samples were then pulled within these two strata based on region (Africa, Asia (including Turkey), Latin-America, some countries from Europe).","The sample consists of the following populations: Norwegian citizens who are immigrants, Norwegian citizens who are descendants of immigrants, and foreign nationals who had voting rights in the 2015 local elections.","The sample consists of immigrants and Norwegian born persons (age 16-39), with immigrant parents (age 16-74) who have been living in Norway for at least two years as of 1 October 2015 and who are from Turkey, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, or Vietnam."," The sample was taken from twelve countries: Poland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Eritrea and Somalia. The sample is not stratified by gender or age. The data collection was carried out either by personal attendance or by telephone, in the respondent's own language. The response rate totalled just over 54%, with large variations between the countries. The gross sample in some country groups was increased to reach the goal of interviewing 350 immigrants from each of the twelve countries, and interviewing 250 Norwegian born persons from each of the four countries. This was important in order to be able to carry out desired analyses afterwards. Weights are calculated so that they will correct for ender, age, education, region and country background biases.","The survey includes people with an immigrant background and their descendants from one of the ten largest non-western immigrant countries in Norway (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Somalia and Chile)."
